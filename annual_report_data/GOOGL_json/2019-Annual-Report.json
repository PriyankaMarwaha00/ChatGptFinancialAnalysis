BUSINESS Overview As our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders\u2019 letter, \u201cGoogle is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one.\u201d That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history \u2014 inspiring us to do things like tackling deep computer science problems, such as our investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing. Alphabet is a collection of businesses \u2014 the largest of which is Google. We report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Our Other Bets include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business. We take a long term view and manage the portfolio of Other Bets with the discipline and rigor needed to deliver long-term returns. Each of our businesses are designed to prosper through strong leaders and independence. Access and technology for everyone The Internet is one of the world\u2019s most powerful equalizers, capable of propelling new ideas and people forward. Today, our mission to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then, we\u2019ve evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that helps you get things done. We\u2019re focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone. We aspire to give everyone the tools they need to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Across Google, we\u2019re focused on continually innovating in areas where technology can have an impact on people\u2019s lives. Our work in AI is helping to produce earlier and more precise flood warnings. We\u2019re also working hard to make sure that our products are accessible to the more than one billion individuals around the world with a disability. For example, Android 10 has automatic Live Captions for videos, podcasts and voicemails to make it easier to consume information on the phone. Our Other Bets are also pursuing initiatives with similar goals. For instance, as a part of our efforts in the Metro Phoenix area, Waymo is working toward our goal of making transportation safer and easier for everyone while Verily is developing tools and platforms to improve health outcomes. Moonshots Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome, but those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. We continue to look toward the future and continue to invest for the long-term. As we said in the original founders\u2019 letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. The power of machine learning Across the company, machine learning and AI are increasingly driving many of our latest innovations. Within Google, our investments in machine learning over a decade have enabled us to build products that are smarter and more helpful. For example, our investments in AI are enabling doctors to detect cancer earlier. Machine learning powers the Google Assistant and many of our newer technologies. Google Serving our users We have always been a company committed to building products that have the potential to improve the lives of millions of people. Our product innovations have made our services widely used, and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. Google\u2019s core products and platforms, such as Android, Chrome, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube each have over one billion monthly active users. As the majority of Alphabet\u2019s big bets continue to reside within Google, an important benefit of the shift to Alphabet has been the tremendous focus that we\u2019re able to have on Google\u2019s many extraordinary opportunities. ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT 1 ", "PART I ITEM 1 BUSINESS Our products have come a long way since the company was founded more than two decades ago. Instead of just showing ten blue links in our search results, we are increasingly able to provide direct answers \u2014 even if you\u2019re speaking your question using Voice Search \u2014 which makes it quicker, easier and more natural to find what you\u2019re looking for. With Google Lens, you can use your phone\u2019s camera to identify an unfamiliar landmark or find a trailer from a movie poster. Over time, we have also added other services that let you access information quickly and easily \u2014 like Google Maps, which helps you navigate to a store while showing you current traffic conditions, or Google Photos, which helps you store and organize your photos. This drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery and creation of digital content, on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. And with the migration to mobile, people are consuming more digital content by watching more videos, playing more games, listening to more music, reading more books, and using more apps than ever before. Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people around the world to find great digital content. Fueling all of these great digital experiences are powerful platforms and hardware. That\u2019s why we continue to invest in platforms like our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, Chrome operating system, and Daydream virtual reality platform, as well as growing our family of great hardware devices. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful, make your life easier, and get better over time, by combining the best of Google\u2019s AI, software, and hardware. This is reflected in our latest generation of hardware products like Pixel 4 phones and the Google Nest Hub smart display. Creating beautiful products that people rely on every day is a journey that we are investing in for the long run. Key to building helpful products for users is our commitment to keeping their data safe online. As the Internet evolves, we continue to invest in our industry-leading security technologies and privacy tools, such as the addition of auto-delete controls to enable users to automatically delete activity after 3 or 18 months and incognito mode in YouTube and Maps. Google was a company built in the cloud. We continue to invest in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and AI. We see significant opportunity in helping businesses enhance these strengths with features like data migration, modern development environments and machine learning tools to provide enterprise-ready cloud services, including Google Cloud Platform and G Suite. Google Cloud Platform enables developers to build, test, and deploy applications on Google\u2019s highly scalable and reliable infrastructure. Our G Suite productivity tools \u2014 which include apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, and more \u2014 are designed with real-time collaboration and machine intelligence to help people work smarter. Because more and more of today\u2019s great digital experiences are being built in the cloud, our Google Cloud products help businesses of all sizes take advantage of the latest technology advances to operate more efficiently. How we make money The goal of our advertising products is to deliver relevant ads at just the right time and to give people useful commercial information, regardless of the device they\u2019re using. We also provide advertisers with tools that help them better attribute and measure their advertising campaigns. Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses, and we offer a wide range of products across devices and formats. We generate revenues primarily by delivering both performance advertising and brand advertising. zz Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on, leading to direct engagement with advertisers. Most of our performance advertisers pay us when a user engages in their ads. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads that appear on Google properties and the properties of Google Network Members. In addition, Google Network Members use our platforms to display relevant ads on their properties, generating revenues when site visitors view or click on the ads. We continue to invest in our advertising programs and make significant upgrades. zz Brand advertising helps enhance users\u2019 awareness of and affinity with advertisers\u2019 products and services, through videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns. We have built a world-class ad technology platform for advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital marketing businesses. We aim to ensure great user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies. We also seek to improve the measurability of advertising so advertisers know when their campaigns are effective. We have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. We focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, ranging from filtering out invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year to closely monitoring the sites, apps, and videos where ads appear and blacklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content. We continue to look to the future and are making long-term investments that will grow revenues beyond advertising, including Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware, and YouTube. We are also investing in research efforts in AI and quantum computing to foster innovation across our businesses and create new opportunities. 2 ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT ", "PART I ITEM 1 BUSINESS Other Bets Throughout Alphabet, we are also using technology to try and solve big problems across many industries. Alphabet\u2019s investment in our portfolio of Other Bets include emerging businesses at various stages of development, ranging from those in the research and development phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization, and our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses in the medium to long term. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues are primarily generated from internet and TV services, as well as licensing and R&D services. Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors. We are investing in our portfolio of Other Bets and being very deliberate about the focus, scale, and pace of investments. Competition Our business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business, particularly from companies that seek to connect people with online information and provide them with relevant advertising. We face competition from: zz General purpose search engines and information services, such as Baidu, Microsoft\u2019s Bing, Naver, Seznam, Verizon\u2019s Yahoo, and Yandex. zz Vertical search engines and e-commerce websites, such as Amazon and eBay (e-commerce), Booking\u2019s Kayak (travel queries), Microsoft\u2019s LinkedIn (job queries), and WebMD (health queries). Some users will navigate directly to such content, websites, and apps rather than go through Google. zz Social networks, such as Facebook, Snapchat, and Twitter. Some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines. zz Other forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television. Our advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline. zz Other online advertising platforms and networks, including Amazon, AppNexus, Criteo, and Facebook, that compete for advertisers that use Google Ads, our primary auction-based advertising platform. zz Providers of digital video services, such as Amazon, Apple, AT&T, Disney, Facebook, Hulu, Netflix and TikTok. In businesses that are further afield from our advertising business, we compete with companies that have longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers and users. We face competition from: zz Other digital content and application platform providers, such as Amazon and Apple. zz Companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms. zz Providers of enterprise cloud services, including Alibaba, Amazon, and Microsoft. zz Digital assistant providers, such as Amazon and Apple. Competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to deliver and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses. Specifically, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining: zz Users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security and availability of our products and services. zz Advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels. zz Content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them. Intellectual Property We rely on various intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights. We have also filed patent applications in the U.S. and foreign countries covering certain of our technology, and acquired patent assets to supplement our portfolio. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our rights to other parties. ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT 3 ", "PART I ITEM 1 BUSINESS Culture and Employees We take great pride in our culture. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and encourage the iteration of ideas to address complex technical challenges. Transparency and open dialogue are central to how we work, and we aim to ensure that company news reaches our employees first through internal channels. Despite our rapid growth, we still cherish our roots as a startup and wherever possible empower employees to act on great ideas regardless of their role or function within the company. We strive to hire great employees, with backgrounds and perspectives as diverse as those of our global users. We work to provide an environment where these talented people can have fulfilling careers addressing some of the biggest challenges in technology and society. Our employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue investing in hiring talented employees and to provide competitive compensation programs to our employees. As of December 31, 2019, we had 118,899 full-time employees. Although we have work councils and statutory employee representation obligations in certain countries, our U.S. employees are not represented by a labor union. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff. Ongoing Commitment to Sustainability We strive to build sustainability into everything we do from designing and operating efficient data centers, advancing carbon-free energy, creating sustainable workplaces, building better devices and services, empowering users with technology, and enabling a responsible supply chain. Google has been carbon neutral since 2007 and we are the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world. In 2018, for the second consecutive year, we matched 100% of our electricity consumption with renewable energy purchases, as reported in our 2019 Environmental Report. Some other 2019 highlights and achievements include: zz We made our largest corporate purchase of renewable energy: 18 new energy deals totaling 1,600 megawatts, which is anticipated to spur the construction of more than $2 billion in new energy infrastructure. zz 100% of Nest products launched in 2019 include recycled plastic content and we launched carbon neutral shipping for Google\u2019s direct customers who buy a product on Google Shopping or purchase Made by Google hardware. zz The Environmental Insights Explorer is enabling municipalities \u2014 which represent more than 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions according to the 2016 United Nations Habitat World Cities Report \u2014 to estimate emissions and develop climate action plans. In 2019, we expanded this tool to more than 100 cities worldwide. We believe that climate change is one of the most significant global challenges of our time. In 2017, we developed a climate resilience strategy, which included conducting a climate scenario analysis. We have been on CDP\u2019s (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) Climate Change A list for five consecutive years. We believe our CDP report reflects the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). More information on Google\u2019s approach to sustainability can be found in our annual sustainability reports. The content of our sustainability reports are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC. Seasonality Our business is affected by seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends such as traditional retail seasonality. Available Information Our website is located at www.abc.xyz, and our investor relations website is located at www.abc.xyz/investor. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and our Proxy Statements, and any amendments to these reports, are available through our investor relations website, free of charge, after we file them with the SEC. We also provide a link to the section of the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov that has all of the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC.

RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described below, which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Risks Specific to our Company We generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising, and reduced spending by advertisers, a loss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize ads could harm our business. We generated over 83% of total revenues from the display of ads online in 2019. Many of our advertisers, companies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their contracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective monetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, as well as changes to other companies\u2019 advertising policies or practices may affect the advertising that we are able to provide, which could harm our business. In addition, technologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult or that block the display of ads altogether and some providers of online services have integrated technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Adverse macroeconomic conditions can also have a material negative effect on the demand for advertising and cause our advertisers to reduce the amounts they spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. We face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our business and operating results. Our business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology and new and existing products and services. We have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer operating histories in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions, continuing to invest heavily in research and development and in talent, aggressively initiating intellectual property claims (whether or not meritorious), and continuing to compete aggressively for users, advertisers, customers, and content providers. Our competitors may be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before us. For example, we are investing significantly in subscription-based products and services such as YouTube, which face intense competition from large experienced companies with well established relationships with users. Our operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the needs of our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. As technologies continue to develop, our competitors may be able to offer experiences that are, or that are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. This may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive. If our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers, our operating results could be harmed. ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT 5 ", "PART I ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS Our ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could disrupt our current operations and harm our financial condition and operating results. We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. The investments that we are making across Google and Other Bets reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. Our investments in Google and Other Bets span a wide range of industries beyond online advertising. Such investments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in pursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated liabilities. These endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of management resources and, with respect to Other Bets, the use of alternative investment, governance, or compensation structures that may fail to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives. Within Google, we continue to invest heavily in hardware, including our smartphones and home devices, which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, and price and feature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide hardware that competes effectively. We are also devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services, including Google Cloud Platform and G Suite. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services and hire talent, particularly to support and scale the Cloud salesforce. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models are competitive and evolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objectives. Within Other Bets, we are investing significantly in the areas of health, life sciences, and transportation, among others. These investment areas face intense competition from large experienced and well-funded competitors and our offerings may not be able to compete effectively or to operate at sufficient levels of profitability. In addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use artificial intelligence and machine learning, raise ethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services. Because all of these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future. Our revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition and the continued expansion of our business into a variety of new fields. Changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, and property mix and an increasing competition for advertising may also affect our advertising revenue growth rate. We may also experience a decline in our revenue growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, if there is a decrease in the rate of adoption of our products, services, and technologies, or due to deceleration or decline in demand for devices used to access our services, among other factors. In addition to a decline in our revenue growth rate, we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors, such as the continued expansion of our business into new fields, including products and services such as hardware, Google Cloud, Google Play, gaming, and subscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins lower than those we generate from advertising. We may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing competition and increased costs for many aspects of our business, including within advertising where changes such as device mix, property mix, and partner agreements can affect margin. The margin we earn on revenues generated from our Google Network Members could also decrease in the future if we pay a larger percentage of advertising fees to them. We may also pay increased TAC to our distribution partners as well as increased content acquisition costs to content providers. We may also face an increase in infrastructure costs, supporting businesses such as Search, Google Cloud, and YouTube. Additionally, our spend to promote new products and services or distribute certain products and services or increased investment in our innovation efforts across Google and our Other Bets businesses may affect our operating margins. Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance. 6 ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT ", "PART I ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services and brand as well as affect our ability to compete. Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable. We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and other sensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word \u201cGoogle\u201d could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word \u201csearch.\u201d Some courts have ruled that \u201cGoogle\u201d is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the United States, may reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word \u201cGoogle\u201d to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. Our business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. Our strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Google and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. Our brands may be negatively affected by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and security issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to appropriately respond to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers, or to otherwise adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our brands. Our brands may also be negatively affected by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be false or misleading. Furthermore, failure to maintain and enhance equity in our brands may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a range of settings. We face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could harm our financial condition, operating results, and prospects. We face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability to supply both our products and our internet-based services. We rely on other companies to manufacture many of our assemblies and finished products, to design certain of our components and parts, and to participate in the distribution of our products and services. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them. We may experience supply shortages and price increases driven by raw material availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, tariffs, trade disputes and barriers, natural disasters, the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires, and increased storm severity), and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers. We may experience shortages or other supply chain disruptions that could negatively affect our operations. In addition, some of the components we use in our technical infrastructure and products are available only from a single source or limited sources, and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption. In addition, a significant hardware supply interruption could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions. ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT 7 ", "PART I ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS We may enter into long term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and conditions. We may be liable for materials and products that are not consumed due to market acceptance, technological change, obsolescences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because many of our hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of our hardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and negatively affect our financial results. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply. Our products and services may have quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing, or operations. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers. If the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or services are defective, it could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. We require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies, such as the Google Supplier Code of Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data security, environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. Violations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm to key relationships, and damage to our reputation. Their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property, could affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims. Interruption, interference with, or failure of our information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, complications with the design or implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system could harm our business and operations. The availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage, interference, or interruption from terrorist attacks, natural disasters, the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires, and increased storm severity), power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, ransomware attacks, computer denial of service attacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems. Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and, in some cases, to potential disruptions resulting from problems experienced by facility operators. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster, closure of a facility, or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and may contain errors or vulnerabilities, which could result in interruptions in or failure of our services or systems. In addition, we rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results. We are in the process of a multi-year implementation of a new ERP system, which will replace much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve data management, and provide timely information to our management team. We may not be able to successfully implement the ERP system without experiencing delays, increased costs, and other difficulties. Failure to successfully design and implement the new ERP system as planned could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the ERP system as planned or the ERP system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be negatively affected. Our international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, our financial condition, and operating results. Our international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to continue to grow internationally. International revenues accounted for approximately 54% of our consolidated revenues in 2019. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the following: zz Restrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S. zz Import and export requirements, tariffs, trade disputes and barriers, and customs classifications that may prevent us from offering products or providing services to a particular market, or that could limit our ability to source assemblies and finished products from a particular market, and may increase our operating costs. zz Longer payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud. zz Evolving foreign events, including Brexit, the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union (EU). Brexit may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to new regulatory costs and challenges (including the transfer of personal data between the EU and the United Kingdom), in addition to other adverse effects that we are unable to effectively anticipate. 8 ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT ", "PART I ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS zz Anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain payments to government officials, violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties. zz Uncertainty regarding liability for services and content, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedent. zz Different employee/employer relationships, existence of works councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions. Because we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Hedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results. Risks Related to our Industry People access the Internet through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to evolve with the advancement of technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our products and services developed for these new interfaces, our business could be harmed. People access the Internet through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers, mobile phones, smartphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables, automobiles, and television-streaming devices. Our products and services may be less popular on these new interfaces. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not be available on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices. In addition, search queries are increasingly being undertaken via voice-activated speakers, apps, social media or other platforms, which could harm our business. It is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to creating and supporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices. Failing to attract and retain a substantial number of new device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and users, or failing to develop products and technologies that work well on new devices and platforms, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results and ability to capture future business opportunities. Data privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could damage our reputation, cause us to incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services. Software bugs or defects, security breaches, and attacks on our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users and customers\u2019 ability to use our products and services, harming our business operations and reputation. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other data-privacyrelated matters, even if unfounded, could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our policies and practices may change over time as expectations regarding privacy and data change. Our products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information, and bugs, theft, misuse, defects, vulnerabilities in our products and services, and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of this information, improper use and disclosure of such information, litigation, and other potential liability. Systems and control failures, security breaches, failure to comply with our privacy policies, and/or inadvertent disclosure of user data could result in government and legal exposure, seriously harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our business, and impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers. We expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security protections that shield against bugs, theft, misuse, or security vulnerabilities or breaches. We experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis. We may experience future security issues, whether due to employee error or malfeasance or system errors or vulnerabilities in our or other parties\u2019 systems, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure. Government inquiries and enforcement actions, litigation, and adverse press coverage could harm our business. We may be unable to anticipate or detect attacks or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures. Attacks and security issues could also compromise trade secrets and other sensitive information, harming our business. While we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including dedicated worldwide incident response teams, our response process may not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not respond quickly enough, or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident. As a result, we may suffer significant legal, reputational, or financial exposure, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT 9 ", "PART I ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS Our ongoing investments in safety, security, and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of our platforms and misuse of user data. In addition to our efforts to mitigate cyber attacks, we are making significant investments in safety, security, and content review efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties, including investigations and review of platform applications that could access the information of users of our services. As a result of these efforts, we could discover incidents of unnecessary access to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. We may not discover all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data limitations, including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, or other factors, and we may be notified of such incidents or activity via third parties. Such incidents and activities may include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper ad purchases, activities that threaten people\u2019s safety on- or offline, or instances of spamming, scraping, or spreading disinformation. We may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate any such incidents. Any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation and brands, require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and adversely affect our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could result in monetary penalties and damages, divert management\u2019s time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight. Problematic content, including low-quality user-generated content, web spam, content farms, and other violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services, which could damage our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services. We, like others in the industry, face violations of our content guidelines, including sophisticated attempts by bad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate revenues, or to otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest or intent. While we invest significantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relevant results and to detect and prevent low-quality content and invalid traffic, we may be unable to adequately detect and prevent such abuses. Many websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in search results than our search engine\u2019s assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts (known as \u201cweb spam\u201d) may affect the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false, misleading or undesirable content. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam in most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their rankings. We continuously combat web spam in our search results, including through indexing technology that makes it harder for spam-like, less useful web content to rank highly. We also continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam from abusing our platforms. We also face other challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, including content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve their search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes focused on low-quality websites. If we fail to detect and prevent an increase in problematic content, it could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our financial condition or operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could result in monetary penalties and damages, divert management\u2019s time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight. Our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers. Our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers have taken, or have stated that they may take measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, or by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet access providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the United States and elsewhere regarding such protections. For example, in 2018 the United States Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules, which could lead internet access providers to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services. In addition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or blockages. Such interference could result in a loss of existing users, customers and advertisers, goodwill, and increased costs, and could impair our ability to attract new users, customers and advertisers, thereby harming our business. 10 ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT ", "PART I ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Laws and Regulations We are subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny as well as changes in public policies governing a wide range of topics that may negatively affect our business. We and other companies in the technology industry are experiencing increased regulatory scrutiny. For instance, various regulatory agencies, including competition, consumer protection, and privacy authorities, are reviewing aspects of our products and services. We continue to cooperate with these investigations. Prior, existing, and new investigations have in the past and may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business operations, and civil litigation, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Changes in international and local social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics may increase our cost of doing business, limit our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services, and cause us to change our business practices. Further, our investment in a variety of new fields, including the health industry and payment services, also raises a number of new regulatory issues. These factors could harm our business and operating results in material ways. A variety of new and existing laws and/or interpretations could harm our business. We are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. New laws and regulations (or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a manner inconsistent with our practices) may make our products and services less useful, limit our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and services, require us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil or criminal liability, or cause us to change our business practices. These laws and regulations are evolving and involve matters central to our business, including, among others: zz Competition laws and regulations around the world. zz Privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 that came into effect in January of 2020, which gives new data privacy rights to California residents, and SB-327 in California, which regulates the security of data in connection with internet connected devices. zz Data protection laws passed by many states within the U.S. and by certain countries regarding notification to data subjects and/ or regulators when there is a security breach of personal data. zz Copyright laws, such as the EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market (EUCD) of April 17, 2019, which increases the liability of content-sharing services with respect to content uploaded by their users. It has also created a new property right in news publications that will limit the ability of some online services to interact with or present such content. Each EU Member State must implement the EUCD by June 7, 2021. In addition, there are new constraining licensing regimes that limit our ability to operate with respect to copyright protected works. zz Data localization laws, which generally mandate that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored and/or processed within that country. zz Various U.S. and international laws that govern the distribution of certain materials to children and regulate the ability of online services to collect information from minors. zz Various laws with regard to content removal and disclosure obligations, such as the Network Enforcement Act in Germany, which may affect our businesses and operations and may subject us to significant fines if such laws are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices or when we may not proactively discover such content due to the scale of third-party content and the limitations of existing technologies. Other countries, including Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom, have implemented or are considering similar legislation imposing penalties for failure to remove certain types of content. In addition, the applicability and scope of these laws, as interpreted by the courts, remain uncertain and could harm our business. For example: zz We rely on statutory safe harbors, as set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in the United States and the E-Commerce Directive in Europe, against copyright liability for various linking, caching, and hosting activities. Any legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us. zz Court decisions such as the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on May 13, 2014 on the \u2018right to be forgotten,\u2019 which allows individuals to demand that Google remove search results about them in certain instances, may limit the content we can show to our users and impose significant operational burdens. zz Court decisions that require Google to remove links not just in the jurisdiction of the issuing court, but for all versions of the search engine worldwide, including in locations where the content at issue is lawful, may limit the content we can show to our users and impose significant operational burdens. The Supreme Court of Canada issued such a decision against Google in June 2017, and others could treat its decision as persuasive. With respect to the \u2018right to be forgotten,\u2019 a follow-up case of the CJEU ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT 11 ", "PART I ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS on September 24, 2019 ruled that a search engine operator is not required to remove links from all versions of the search engine worldwide, but the court also noted in some cases, removal of links from all versions of the search engine available from the EU (including non-EU specific versions) may be required. The introduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies, our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions we take may subject us to additional laws and regulations. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future. Any failure on our part to comply with laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties. We are subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings that may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. We are subject to claims, suits, and government investigations involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, consumer protection, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Due to our manufacturing and sale of an expanded suite of products, including hardware as well as Google Cloud offerings, we may also be subject to a variety of claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects, among other litigation. We may also be subject to claims involving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental impacts, or service disruptions or failures. Any of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment. The resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in, and may in the future result in, additional substantial fines, penalties, injunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. We may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content. Our products and services let users exchange information, advertise products and services, conduct business, and engage in various online activities. We also place advertisements displayed on other companies\u2019 websites, and we offer third-party products, services, and/or content. The law relating to the liability of online service providers for others\u2019 activities on their services is still somewhat unsettled both within the U.S. and internationally. Claims have been brought against us for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright and trademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, torts, fraud, or other legal theories based on the nature and content of information available on or via our services. We may be subject to claims by virtue of our involvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or providing access to content created by third parties. Defense of any such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources, may result in monetary liabilities or penalties, and may require us to change our business in an adverse manner. Privacy and data protection regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas. Adverse interpretations of these laws could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Authorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection and limits on encryption of user data. Adverse legal rulings, legislation, or regulation could result in fines and orders requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to provide services, harming our business operations. Complying with these evolving laws could result in substantial costs and harm the quality of our products and services, negatively affecting our business. Recent legal developments in Europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from Europe to the United States. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services that we offer to EU users or customers, or the monitoring of their behavior in the EU. The GDPR creates a range of new compliance obligations. Ensuring compliance with the GDPR is an ongoing commitment that involves substantial costs, and despite our efforts, governmental authorities or others have asserted and may continue to assert that our business practices fail to comply with its requirements. If our operations are found to violate GDPR requirements, we may incur substantial fines, have to change our business practices, and face reputational harm, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, serious breaches of the GDPR can result in administrative fines of up to 4% of annual worldwide revenues. Fines of up to 2% of annual worldwide revenues can be levied for other specified violations. The EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks allow U.S. companies that self-certify to the U.S. Department of Commerce and publicly commit to comply with specified requirements to import personal data from the EU and Switzerland. However, these frameworks face a number of legal challenges and their validity remains subject to legal, regulatory, and political developments in both Europe and the U.S. The potential invalidation of data transfer mechanisms could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the EEA. 12 ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT ", "PART I ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS These developments create some uncertainty, and compliance obligations could cause us to incur costs or harm the operations of our products and services in ways that harm our business. We face, and may continue to face intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend, result in significant damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future. We, like other internet, technology and media companies, hold large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent-holding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims against us. As we have grown, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased and may continue to increase as we develop new products, services, and technologies. We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Other parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and ceaseand-desist orders, which could limit our ability to sell our products or services in the U.S. or elsewhere if our products or services or those of our customers or suppliers are found to infringe the intellectual property subject to the claims. Adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. They may also cause us to change our business practices and require development of non-infringing products, services, or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. Many of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend against certain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from intellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual property claims. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. To the extent such claims are successful, they may harm our business, including our product and service offerings, financial condition, or operating results. Risks Related to Ownership of our Stock We cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that any share repurchase program will enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases could increase the volatility of the price of our stock and could diminish our cash reserves. In January 2018, January 2019, and July 2019, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $8.6 billion, $12.5 billion, and $25.0 billion of its Class C capital stock, respectively. Share repurchases pursuant to the January 2018 and January 2019 authorizations were completed in 2019. As of December 31, 2019, $20.8 billion remains available for repurchase. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. Our share repurchase program could affect the price of our stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. The concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters. Our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A common stock has one vote per share, and our Class C capital stock has no voting rights. As of December 31, 2019, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 84.3% of our outstanding Class B common stock, which represented approximately 51.2% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C capital stock carries no voting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C capital stock, including in future stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey\u2019s current relative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, which could reduce the market price of our Class A common stock and our Class C capital stock. ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT 13 ", "PART I ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable. Provisions in Alphabet\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following: zz Our certificate of incorporation provides for a tri-class capital stock structure. As a result of this structure, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets. This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover, or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial. As noted above, the issuance of the Class C capital stock could have the effect of continuing the influence of Larry and Sergey. zz Our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors. zz Our stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to take certain actions without holding a stockholders\u2019 meeting. zz Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates. zz Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company. zz Our board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock. The ability to issue undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us. As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us. General Risks Our operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations. Our operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Our quarterly, year-to-date, and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may differ significantly from our historical rates. Our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. Any of these events could cause our stock price to fall. Each of the risk factors listed in this section in addition to the following factors may affect our operating results: zz Our ability to continue to attract and retain users and customers to our products and services. zz Our ability to attract user and/or customer adoption of, and generate significant revenues from, new products, services, and technologies in which we have invested considerable time and resources. zz Our ability to monetize traffic on Google properties and our Google Network Members\u2019 properties across various devices. zz Revenue fluctuations caused by changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, and property mix. zz The amount of revenues and expenses generated and incurred in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and our ability to manage the resulting risk through our foreign exchange risk management program. zz The amount and timing of operating costs and expenses and capital expenditures related to the maintenance and expansion of our businesses, operations, and infrastructure. zz Our focus on long-term goals over short-term results. zz The results of our acquisitions, divestitures, and our investments in risky projects, including new businesses, products, services, and technologies. zz Our ability to keep our products and services operational at a reasonable cost and without service interruptions. zz The seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising spending, and underlying business trends such as traditional retail seasonality. Our rapid growth has tended to mask the cyclicality and seasonality of our business. As our growth rate has slowed, the cyclicality and seasonality in our business has become more pronounced and caused our operating results to fluctuate. 14 ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT ", "PART I ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS zz Geopolitical events, including trade disputes. zz Changes in global business or macroeconomic conditions. Because our businesses are changing and evolving, our historical operating results may not be useful to you in predicting our future operating results. Acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other consequences that may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Acquisitions, joint ventures, investments and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results. We expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions, which could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Some of the areas where we face risks include: zz Diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and other strategic transactions. zz Failure to successfully integrate and further develop the acquired business or technology. zz Implementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company. zz Integration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems, and coordination of product, engineering, and sales and marketing functions. zz Transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms. zz Failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions placed upon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction. zz In the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. zz Cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire. zz Liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, data privacy and security issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities. zz Litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties. Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and other strategic transactions could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. Our acquisitions and other strategic transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition or operating results. Also, the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not materialize. In connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, which may harm our financial condition or operating results. If we were to lose the services of key personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy. Our future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. For instance, Sundar Pichai is critical to the overall management of Alphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an important role in the development of our technology. He also plays a key role in maintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies. The loss of key personnel could seriously harm our business. We rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or maintain our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively. Our performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT 15 ", "PART I ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS In addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization grows, and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures, particularly in light of our holding company structure, adverse changes to our corporate culture could harm our business operations. In preparing our financial statements, we incorporate valuation methodologies that are subjective in nature and valuations may fluctuate over time. We measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt investments, certain other instruments including stock-based compensation awards settled in the stock of certain Other Bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The determination of fair value involves use of appropriate valuation methods and certain unobservable inputs, require management judgment and estimation, and may change over time. As it relates to our non-marketable investments, the market values can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, performance and financial results of the underlying companies, foreign exchange rates, changes in interest rates, including changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rates that replace LIBOR, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market in general, or other factors. Since January 2018, we adjust the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments to fair value for observable transactions of identical or similar investments of the same issuer or for impairments. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), which increases the volatility of our other income (expense). As a result of these factors, the value or liquidity of our cash equivalents, as well as our marketable and non-marketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. We could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities. Our future income taxes could be negatively affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws), as well as certain discrete items. In addition, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have received, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, including in Europe, on various tax-related assertions, such as transfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition and could require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. It may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, resulting in the diversion of management\u2019s time and attention. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Furthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes in ways that impair our financial results. In particular, France, Italy, and other countries have enacted or are considering digital services taxes, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax regimes. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development recently released a proposal relating to its initiative for modernizing international tax rules, with the goal of having different countries enact legislation to implement a modernized and aligned international tax framework, but there can be no guarantee that this will occur. The trading price for our Class A common stock and non-voting Class C capital stock may continue to be volatile. The trading price of our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile. For example, from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019, the closing price of our Class A common stock ranged from $1,025.47 per share to $1,362.47 per share, and the closing price of our Class C capital stock ranged from $1,016.06 to $1,361.17 per share. In addition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading price of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, among others: zz Quarterly variations in our operating results or those of our competitors. zz Announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, divestitures, investments, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships, or capital commitments. zz Recommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates. 16 ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT ", "PART I ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS zz Announcements about our earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations, the risk of which is enhanced because it is our policy not to give guidance on earnings. zz Announcements by our competitors of their earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations. zz Commentary by industry and market professionals about our products, strategies, and other matters affecting our business and results, regardless of its accuracy. zz The volume of shares of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock available for public sale. zz Sales of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock by us or by our stockholders (including sales by our directors, executive officers, and other employees). zz Short sales, hedging, and other derivative transactions on shares of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock. zz The perceived values of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock relative to one another. zz Any share repurchase program. In addition, the stock market in general, which can be affected by various factors, including overall economic and political conditions, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our Class A common stock and our Class C capital stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have omitted discussion of 2017 results where it would be redundant to the discussion previously included in Part II, Item 7 of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended. Trends in Our Business The following trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to affect our future results: zz Users\u2019 behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves. The continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business since inception, contributing to revenue growth, and we expect that this online shift will continue to benefit our business. zz Users are increasingly using diverse devices and modalities to access our products and services, and our advertising revenues are increasingly coming from new formats. Our users are accessing the Internet via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables and smart home devices, and want to feel connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We seek to expand our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business. We generate our advertising revenues increasingly from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising formats, and the margins from the advertising revenues from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures our revenues may be affected. For example, growth in the global smartphone market has slowed due to various factors, including increased market saturation in developed countries, which can affect our mobile advertising revenue growth rates. We expect TAC paid to our distribution partners to increase as our revenues grow and to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic mix; partner mix; partner agreement terms; and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points. We expect these trends to continue to put pressure on our overall margins and affect our revenue growth rates. zz As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings which may affect our monetization. As interactions between users and advertisers change and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to expand and evolve our product offerings to serve their changing needs. Over time, we expect our monetization trends to fluctuate. For example, we have seen an increase in YouTube engagement ads, which monetize at a lower rate than traditional search ads. zz As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets continue to increase and movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues. The shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., including in emerging markets, and we continue to develop localized versions of our products and relevant advertising programs useful to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased revenues from international markets over time and we expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could impact our margins as developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets. Our international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings. zz The portion of our revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing and may affect margins. Non-advertising revenues have grown over time. We expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our offerings to our users through products and services like Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware products, and YouTube subscriptions. Across these initiatives, we currently derive non-advertising revenues primarily from sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings and subscription and other services. 22 ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT ", "PART II ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The margins on these revenues vary significantly and may be lower than the margins on our advertising revenues. A number of our Other Bets initiatives are in their initial development stages, and as such, the sources of revenues from these businesses could change over time and the revenues could be volatile. zz As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures. We continue to make significant R&D investments in areas of strategic focus such as advertising, cloud, machine learning, and search, as well as in new products and services. In addition, our capital expenditures have grown over the last several years. We expect this trend to continue in the long term as we invest heavily in land and buildings for data centers and offices, and information technology infrastructure, which includes servers and network equipment. In addition, acquisitions remain an important part of our strategy and use of capital, and we expect to continue to spend cash on acquisitions and other investments. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings, as well as expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas. zz Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them. Our employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs to our employees.

Google advertising revenues Our advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network Members\u2019 properties and the correlation between these items, have been affected and may continue to be affected by various factors, including: zz advertiser competition for keywords; zz changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy; zz changes in device mix; zz changes in foreign currency exchange rates; zz fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs; zz general economic conditions; zz seasonality; and zz traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels. Our advertising revenue growth rate has been affected over time as a result of a number of factors, including challenges in maintaining our growth rate as revenues increase to higher levels; changes in our product mix; changes in advertising quality or formats and delivery; the evolution of the online advertising market; increasing competition; our investments in new business strategies; query growth rates; and shifts in the geographic mix of our revenues. We also expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to be affected by evolving user preferences, the acceptance by users of our products and services as they are delivered on diverse devices and modalities, our ability to create a seamless experience for both users and advertisers, and movements in foreign currency exchange rates.

GOOGLE SEARCH & OTHER Our Google Search & other revenues increased $12,819 million from 2018 to 2019. The growth was primarily driven by interrelated factors including increases in search queries resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, continued growth in advertiser activity, and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery. Revenue growth was partially offset by the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. Our Google Search & other revenues increased $15,485 million from 2017 to 2018. The growth was primarily driven by increases in mobile search resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, as well as continued growth in advertiser activity. Growth was also driven by improvements in ad formats and delivery, primarily on desktop. Additionally, revenue growth was favorably affected by the general weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. YOUTUBE ADS YouTube ads revenues increased $3,994 million from 2018 to 2019 and increased $3,005 million from 2017 to 2018. The largest contributors to the growth during both periods were our direct response and brand advertising products, both of which benefited from improvements to ad formats and delivery and increased advertiser spending. GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u2019 PROPERTIES Our Google Network Members\u2019 properties revenues increased $1,537 million from 2018 to 2019. The growth was primarily driven by strength in both AdManager (included in what was previously referred to as programmatic advertising buying) and AdMob, partially offset by the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. Our Google Network Members\u2019 properties revenues increased $2,394 million from 2017 to 2018, primarily driven by strength in both AdMob and AdManager, offset by a decline in our traditional AdSense businesses. Additionally, the growth was favorably affected by the general weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. USE OF MONETIZATION METRICS Paid clicks for our Google properties represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users related to searches on Google.com and other owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play; and viewed YouTube engagement ads (certain YouTube ad formats are not included in our click or impression based metrics). Impressions for our Google Network Members\u2019 properties include impressions displayed to users served on Google Network Members\u2019 properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense and Google Ad Manager.

The positive effect on our revenues from an increase in paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. The decrease in cost-per-click was primarily driven by continued growth in YouTube engagement ads where cost-per-click remains lower than on our other advertising platforms. Cost-per-click was also affected by changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product changes, product mix, property mix, and fluctuations of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.

Use of Constant Currency Revenues and Constant Currency Revenue Growth The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons. Our international revenues are favorably affected as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably affected as the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. Our revenues are also favorably affected by net hedging gains and unfavorably affected by net hedging losses. ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT 27 ", "PART II ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues and constant currency revenue growth for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue growth on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period. Constant currency revenue growth (expressed as a percentage) is calculated by determining the increase in current period revenues over prior period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.

Our APAC revenue growth from 2018 to 2019 was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Australian dollar and South Korean won, partially offset by the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the Japanese yen. Our Other Americas revenue growth from 2018 to 2019 was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Brazilian real and Argentine peso. Costs and Expenses Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues consists of TAC which are paid to Google Network Members primarily for ads displayed on their properties and amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers. The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network Members\u2019 properties are significantly higher than the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google properties because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network Members\u2019 properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network Members. Additionally, other cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues excluding TAC) includes the following: zz Content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube advertising and subscription services and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee); zz Expenses associated with our data centers and other operations (including bandwidth, compensation expenses (including stock- based compensation (SBC)), depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs); and zz Inventory related costs for hardware we sell.

The increase was due to increases in other cost of revenues and TAC of $8,984 million and $3,363 million, respectively. The increase in other cost of revenues from 2018 to 2019 was due to an increase in data center and other operations costs. Additionally, there was an increase in content acquisition costs for YouTube consistent with the growth in YouTube revenues. The increase in TAC from 2018 to 2019 was due to increases in TAC paid to distribution partners and to Google Network Members, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 22.9% to 22.3%, primarily due to the favorable revenue mix shift from Google Network Members\u2019 properties to Google properties. The TAC rate on Google properties revenues increased primarily due to the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. The TAC rate on Google Network revenues decreased primarily due to changes in product mix to products that carry a lower TAC rate. Over time, cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: zz The amount of TAC paid to Google Network Members, which is affected by a combination of factors such as geographic mix, product mix, revenue share terms, and fluctuations of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies; zz The amount of TAC paid to distribution partners, which is affected by changes in device mix, geographic mix, partner mix, partner agreement terms such as revenue share arrangements, and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; zz Relative revenue growth rates of Google properties and Google Network Members\u2019 properties; zz Costs associated with our data centers and other operations to support ads, Google Cloud, Search, YouTube and other products; ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT 29 ", "PART II ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS zz Content acquisition costs, which are primarily affected by the relative growth rates in our YouTube advertising and subscription revenues; zz Costs related to hardware sales; and zz Increased proportion of non-advertising revenues, which generally have higher costs of revenues, relative to our advertising revenues.

This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in gains on equity securities, which were $2,649 million in 2019 as compared to $5,460 million in 2018. The majority of the gains in both periods were unrealized. The effect of the decrease in gains on equity securities was partially offset by a decrease in performance fees. The decrease in other income (expense) was also driven by a decrease in gains on debt securities primarily due to an unrealized gain recognized in 2018 resulting from the modification of the terms of a non-marketable debt security. Performance fees of $1,203 million have been reclassified from general and administrative expenses to other income (expense), net, for 2018 to conform with current period presentation. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Over time, other income (expense), net, as a percentage of revenues may be affected by market dynamics and other factors. Equity values generally change daily for marketable equity securities and upon the occurrence of observable price changes or upon impairment of non-marketable equity securities. In addition, volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets could result in a significant change in the value of our equity securities. Fluctuations in the value of these investments has, and we expect will continue to, contribute to volatility of OI&E in future periods.

Additionally, our future effective tax rate may be affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items. Quarterly Results of Operations The following tables presenting our quarterly results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have prepared the unaudited information on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements. Our operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future quarters or for a full year. The following table presents our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2019. This table includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated financial position and operating results for the quarters presented. Seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and advertiser expenditures, underlying business trends such as traditional retail seasonality and macroeconomic conditions have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business. Commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused, and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.

Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities and marketable equity securities. As of December 31, 2019, we had long-term taxes payable of $7.3 billion related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the Tax Act. As permitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. In 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European competition law and imposed fines of \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018), and \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. While each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. In November 2019, we entered into an agreement to acquire Fitbit, a leading wearables brand, for $7.35 per share, representing a total purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion as of the date of the agreement. The acquisition of Fitbit is expected to be completed in 2020, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long term growth of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace and form of capital return to stockholders. We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $5.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2019. We have $4.0 billion of revolving credit facilities expiring in July 2023 with no amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2019. The interest rate for the credit facilities is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. We believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, potential acquisitions and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2019, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding due in 2021, 2024, and 2026 with a total carrying value of $4.0 billion. As of December 31, 2019, we had remaining authorization of $20.8 billion for repurchase of Class C capital stock. The repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. Please refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to share repurchases. We continue to make significant investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology infrastructure through purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our business. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we spent $23.5 billion on capital expenditures and recognized total operating lease assets of $4.4 billion. As of December 31, 2019, the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 10 years, was $13.9 billion. Finance leases were not material for the year ended December 31, 2019. Please refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the leases. The following table presents our cash flows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 47,971 $ 54,520 Net cash used in investing activities $ (28,504) $ (29,491) Net cash used in financing activities $ (13,179) $ (23,209) Cash Provided by Operating Activities Our largest source of cash provided by our operations are advertising revenues generated by Google properties and Google Network Members\u2019 properties. Additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings and subscription-based products. Our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include payments to our Google Network Members and distribution partners, and payments for content acquisition costs. In addition, uses of cash from operating activities include compensation and related costs, hardware inventory costs, other general corporate expenditures, and income taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities increased from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to increases in cash received from revenues, offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses. ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT 33 ", "PART II ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of our investments in marketable and non-marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of property and equipment, which primarily includes our investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology infrastructure to provide capacity for the growth of our businesses; purchases of marketable and non-marketable securities; and payments for acquisitions. Net cash used in investing activities increased from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to a net increase in purchases of securities and an increase in payments for acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in payments for purchases of property and equipment. The decrease in purchases of property and equipment was driven by decreases in purchases of servers as well as land and buildings for offices, partially offset by an increase in data center construction. Cash Used in Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from sale of interest in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of net payments related to stock-based award activities, repurchases of capital stock, and repayments of debt. Net cash used in financing activities increased from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to an increase in cash payments for repurchases of capital stock and a decrease in proceeds from sale of interest in consolidated entities.

Excluded from the table above are long-term taxes payable of $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2019 primarily related to uncertain tax positions, for which we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. (5) Represents cash obligations recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities, primarily for the construction of offices and certain commercial agreements. These amounts do not include the EC fines which are classified as current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For further information regarding the EC fines, refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors. 34 ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT ", "PART II ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, gains and losses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. We have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. Please see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements. Revenues For the sale of third-party goods and services, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenues on a gross basis, or an agent, and report revenues on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Loss Contingencies We are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, non-income taxes, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Long-lived Assets Long-lived assets, including property and equipment, long-term prepayments, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated from the assets are less than their carrying amount. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT 35 ", "PART II ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fair Value Measurements We measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt investments, certain other instruments including stock-based compensation awards settled in the stock of certain Other Bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate valuation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value whereby it gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. We maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Our use of unobservable inputs reflects the assumptions that market participants would use and may include our own data adjusted based on reasonably available information. We apply judgment in assessing the relevance of observable market data to determine the priority of inputs under the fair value hierarchy, particularly in situations where there is very little or no market activity. In determining the fair values of our non-marketable equity and debt investments, as well as assets acquired (especially with respect to intangible assets) and liabilities assumed in business combinations, we make significant estimates and assumptions, some of which include the use of unobservable inputs. Certain stock-based compensation awards may be settled in the stock of certain of our Other Bets or in cash. These awards are based on the equity values of the respective Other Bet, which requires use of unobservable inputs. We also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized investment returns, i.e. performance fees. We recognize compensation expense based on the estimated payouts, which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized, and may require the use of unobservable inputs. Non-marketable Equity Securities Our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are carried either at fair value or under the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Determining whether an observed transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the rights and obligations of the securities. Recording upward and downward adjustments to the carrying value of our equity securities as a result of observable price changes requires quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities using various valuation methodologies and involves the use of estimates. Non-marketable equity securities are also subject to periodic impairment reviews. Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant effect on the investment\u2019s fair value. Qualitative factors considered include industry and market conditions, financial performance, business prospects, and other relevant events and factors. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative assessments of the fair value of our equity investments using both the market and income approaches which require judgment and the use of estimates, including discount rates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. When our assessment indicates that an impairment exists, we measure our non-marketable securities at fair value. 36 ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT ", "PART II ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \u2014\u2014 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity investment risks Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenues, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Principal currencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro and Japanese yen. For the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% could be experienced in the near term. We use foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the subsidiary. These forward contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward contracts. If an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currencies at the balance sheet dates, it would have resulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately $1 million and $8 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively. The adverse effect as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately $374 million and $662 million, respectively, from foreign exchange contracts in place for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019. We use foreign currency forwards and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency options and forwards reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign currency collars and forwards offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot rate changes as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify them into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2018 and 2019, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately $772 million and $1.1 billion lower as of December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized. We use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency translation risk from our foreign operations. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI related to our net investment hedge would have been approximately $635 million and $936 million lower as of December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Interest Rate Risk Our Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity. We invest primarily in debt securities including those of the U.S. government and its agencies, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, money market and other funds, municipal securities, time deposits, asset backed securities, and debt instruments issued by foreign governments. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as a result of higher market interest rates compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. We account for both fixed and variable rate securities at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold. ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT 37 ", "PART II ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value of our marketable debt security portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for our investment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with 95% confidence interval. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of our marketable debt securities as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 are shown below (in millions): 12-Month Average As of December 31, As of December 31, 2018 Risk Category - Interest Rate $ 58 2019 $ 104 2018 $ 66 2019 $ 90 Actual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation. Equity Investment Risk Our marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings. Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages. We record our marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily determinable market values, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility, and represent $3.3 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2019. A hypothetical adverse price change of 10%, which could be experienced in the near term, would decrease the fair value of our marketable equity securities by $330 million. Our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement alternative). The fair value is measured at the time of the observable transaction, which is not necessarily an indication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are in the early stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early phases and may never materialize and they may experience a decline in financial condition, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on the likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of our investments through liquidity events such as public offerings, acquisitions, private sales or other favorable market events. As of December 31, 2019, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the measurement alternative, was $11.4 billion. Valuations of our equity investments in private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. Volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets could result in a significant impairment charge on our non-marketable equity securities. The carrying values of our equity method investments generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes, however these investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 40 ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT ", "PART II ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA LOSS CONTINGENCIES Description of the Matter The Company is regularly subject to claims, suits, and government investigations involving competition, intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by its users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using their platforms, and other matters. As described in Note 10 to the financial statements \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d such claims could result in adverse consequences. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood, and the estimated amount, of a loss related to such matters. Auditing management\u2019s accounting for and disclosure of loss contingencies from these matters involved challenging and subjective auditor judgement in assessing the Company\u2019s evaluation of the probability of a loss, and the estimated amount or range of loss. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested relevant controls over the identified risks associated with management\u2019s accounting for and disclosure of these matters. This included controls over management\u2019s assessment of the probability of incurrence of a loss and whether the loss or range of loss was reasonably estimable and the development of related disclosures. Our audit procedures included gaining an understanding of previous rulings issued by regulators and the status of ongoing lawsuits, reviewing letters addressing the matters from internal and external legal counsel, meeting with internal legal counsel to discuss the allegations, and obtaining a representation letter from management on these matters. We also evaluated the Company\u2019s disclosures in relation to these matters. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1999.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Alphabet Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Alphabet Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2019 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 3, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California February 3, 2020 42 ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT ", "PART II ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Alphabet Inc.

ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT 47 ", "PART II ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA \u2014\u2014 Alphabet Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (Alphabet) became the successor issuer to Google. We generate revenues primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Noncontrolling interests are not presented separately as the amounts are not material. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Use of Estimates Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the bad debt allowance, sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenues when we transfer control of promised goods or services to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. See Note 2 for further discussion on Revenues. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues. TAC represents the amounts paid to Google Network Members primarily for ads displayed on their properties and amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers. Other cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues excluding TAC) includes the following: zz Content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee); zz Expenses associated with our data centers and other operations (including bandwidth, compensation expense (including SBC), depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs); and zz Inventory related costs for hardware we sell. Stock-based Compensation Stock-based compensation primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity classified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense using the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur. 48 ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT ", "PART II ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA For RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory tax withholding to be paid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding and the tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. Additionally, stock-based compensation includes stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs) and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain of our Other Bets. PSUs are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period. Awards that are liability classified are remeasured at fair value through settlement or maturity (six months and one day after vesting). The fair value of such awards is based on the equity valuation of the respective Other Bet. Performance Fees We have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized investment returns. We recognize compensation expense based on the estimated payouts, which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized. Performance fees, which are primarily related to gains on equity securities, are recorded as a component of other income (expense), net. Certain Risks and Concentrations Our revenues are primarily derived from online advertising, the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly changing. In addition, our revenues are generated from a multitude of markets in countries around the world. Significant changes in this industry or changes in customer buying or advertiser spending behavior could adversely affect our operating results. No individual customer or groups of affiliated customers represented more than 10% of our revenues in 2017, 2018, or 2019. In 2017, 2018, and 2019, we generated approximately 47%, 46%, and 46% of our revenues, respectively, from customers based in the U.S. We are subject to concentrations of credit risk principally from cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. We manage our credit risk exposure through timely assessment of our counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits and use of collateral management. Cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of time deposits, money market and other funds, highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, debt instruments issued by municipalities in the U.S., corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. We perform ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend. We generally do not require collateral from our customers. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have generally been within our expectations. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivative contracts, and non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities, which are adjusted to fair value when observable price changes are identified or when the nonmarketable equity securities are impaired (referred to as the measurement alternative). Other financial assets and liabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value: Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings. Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT 49 ", "PART II ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities We invest all excess cash primarily in government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, time deposits, and money market funds. We classify all marketable investments that have stated maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase as cash equivalents and those with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their stated maturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders\u2019 equity, except for unrealized losses determined to be other-than-temporary, which we record within other income (expense), net. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on a specific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of other income (expense), net. Non-Marketable Investments We account for non-marketable equity investments through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method. Our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative in accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, which we adopted on January 1, 2018. Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments is adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date. We account for our non-marketable investments that meet the definition of a debt security as available-for-sale securities. We classify our non-marketable investments that do not have stated contractual maturity dates, as non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Impairment of Investments We periodically review our debt and equity investments for impairment. For debt securities we consider the duration, severity and the reason for the decline in security value; whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or if the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the security to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as other income (expense), net. For equity securities we consider impairment indicators such as negative changes in industry and market conditions, financial performance, business prospects, and other relevant events and factors. If indicators exist and the fair value of the security is below the carrying amount, we write down the security to fair value. Variable Interest Entities We determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in which we have other variable interests in is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. Periodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the entity is still a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP. Accounts Receivable We record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. We review the accounts receivable by amounts due from customers that are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. In determining the amount of the reserve, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Our payment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer. 50 ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT ", "PART II ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities. Certain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease assets and liabilities. These amounts include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments contingent on wind or solar production for power purchase arrangements, and payments for maintenance and utilities. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the base, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives. Operating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet beginning January 1, 2019. The current portion of our operating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and the long term portion is included in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Property and Equipment Property and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets, construction in progress, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, offices, data centers and related building improvements. Information technology assets include servers and network equipment. We account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We depreciate buildings over periods of seven to 25 years. We depreciate information technology assets generally over periods of three to five years (specifically, three years for servers and three to five years for network equipment). We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for our intended use. Depreciation for equipment, buildings, and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated. Inventory Inventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is computed using the first-in, first-out method. Software Development Costs We expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. Technological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products and as a result, development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented. Software development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented. Business Combinations We include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred. ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT 51 ", "PART II ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets We review property and equipment, long-term prepayments and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If the carrying value of the assets are not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Impairments were not material for the periods presented. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We amortize intangible assets on a straight-line basis with definite lives generally over periods ranging from one to twelve years. Income Taxes We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax assets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the realization of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. We recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision. Foreign Currency Generally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end exchange rates for revenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) as a component of stockholders\u2019 equity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in other income (expense), net. Advertising and Promotional Expenses We expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $5.1 billion, $6.4 billion, and $6.8 billion, respectively. Recent Accounting Pronouncements RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 (ASU 2016-13) \u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\u201d, which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss model which requires the use of forward-looking information to calculate credit loss estimates. It also eliminates the concept of other-than-temporary impairment and requires credit losses related to available-forsale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. These changes will result in earlier recognition of credit losses. We will adopt ASU 2016-13 effective January 1, 2020 with the cumulative effect of adoption recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings. The effect on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures is not expected to be material. RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 (Topic 842) \u201cLeases.\u201d Topic 842 supersedes the lease requirements in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 840, \u201cLeases.\u201d Under Topic 842, lessees are required to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for most leases and provide enhanced disclosures. Leases continue to be classified as either 52 ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT ", "PART II ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA finance or operating. We adopted Topic 842 effective January 1, 2019. The most significant effects of Topic 842 were the recognition of $8.0 billion of operating lease assets and $8.4 billion of operating lease liabilities and the de-recognition of $1.5 billion of buildto-suit assets and liabilities upon adoption. We applied Topic 842 to all leases as of January 1, 2019 with comparative periods continuing to be reported under Topic 840. In the adoption of Topic 842, we carried forward the assessment from Topic 840 of whether our contracts contain or are leases, the classification of our leases, and remaining lease terms. Our accounting for finance leases remains substantially unchanged. The standard did not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows. See Note 4 for further details. PRIOR PERIOD RECLASSIFICATIONS Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation. Hedging gains (losses), which were previously included in Google revenues, are now reported separately as a component of total revenues for all periods presented. See Note 2 for further details. Additionally, performance fees have been reclassified for all periods from general and administrative expenses to other income (expense), net to align with the presentation of the investment gains and losses on which the performance fees are based. See Note 7 for further details. Note 2. Revenues Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services. Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from revenues. The following table presents our revenues disaggregated by type (in millions).

ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT 53 ", "PART II ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Advertising Revenues We generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on Google properties, including Google.com, the Google Search app, YouTube, Google Play, Gmail and Google Maps; and Google Network Members\u2019 properties. Our customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager as part of the Authorized Buyers marketplace, and Google Marketing Platform, among others. We offer advertising on a click, impression or view basis. We recognize revenue each time a user clicks on the ad, when the ad is displayed or a user views the ad. For ads placed on Google Network Members\u2019 properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network Members\u2019 properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and amounts paid to Google Network Members are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers, and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing. Google Cloud Revenues Google Cloud revenues consist primarily of revenues from Google Cloud Platform (which includes infrastructure and data and analytics platform products, and other services), G Suite productivity tools and other enterprise cloud services. Our cloud revenues are provided on either a consumption or subscription basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis is recognized when the customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services. Other Revenues Google other revenues and Other Bets revenues consist primarily of revenues from: zz Google Play, which includes revenues from sale of apps and in-app purchases (which we recognize net of payout to developers) and digital content sold in the Google Play store; zz hardware, including Google Nest home products, Pixelbooks, Pixel phones and other devices; zz YouTube non-advertising including, YouTube premium and YouTube TV subscriptions and other services; and zz other products and services. As it relates to Google other revenues, the most significant judgment is determining whether we are the principal or agent for app sales and in-app purchases through the Google Play store. We report revenues from these transactions on a net basis because our performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a commission. Consequently, the portion of the gross amount billed to end users that is remitted to app developers is not reflected as revenues. Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations Our contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus margin. Customer Incentives and Credits Certain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. Deferred Revenues We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. The increase in the deferred revenue balance for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily driven by cash payments received or due in advance of satisfying our performance obligations, offset by $1.7 billion of revenues recognized that were included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2018. 54 ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT ", "PART II ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Additionally, we have performance obligations associated with commitments in customer contracts, primarily related to Google Cloud, for future services that have not yet been recognized in revenue. This includes related deferred revenue currently recorded and amounts that will be invoiced in future periods. As of December 31, 2019, the amount not yet recognized in revenue from these commitments is $11.4 billion, which reflects our assessment of relevant contract terms. This amount excludes contracts (i) with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. We expect to recognize approximately two thirds over the next 24 months with the remaining thereafter. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer utilization, which could impact our estimate of the remaining amount of commitments and when we expect to recognize such revenues. Sales Commissions We generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses. Note 3. Financial Instruments Debt Securities We classify our marketable debt securities within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value. The following tables summarize our debt securities by significant investment categories as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 (in millions): As of December 31, 2018 Adjusted Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses $ $ Fair Value Cash and Cash Equivalents Marketable Securities 2,202 $ $ Level 2: Time deposits(1) $ 2,202 0 0 $ 2,202 0 Government bonds 53,634 71 (414) 53,291 3,717 49,574 Corporate debt securities 25,383 15 (316) 25,082 44 25,038 (324) 16,605 (1,054) $ 97,180 Mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities Total 16,918 $ 98,137 11 $ 97 $ 0 $ 5,963 16,605 $ 91,217 As of December 31, 2019 Adjusted Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses $ $ Fair Value Cash and Cash Equivalents Marketable Securities 2,294 $ $ Level 2: Time deposits(1) $ 2,294 0 Government bonds 55,033 434 Corporate debt securities 27,164 Mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities 19,453 Total $ 103,944 $ 0 $ 2,294 0 (30) 55,437 4,518 50,919 337 (3) 27,498 44 27,454 96 (41) 19,508 0 19,508 867 $ (74) $ 104,737 $ 6,856 $ 97,881 (1) The majority of our time deposits are domestic deposits.

We recognized gross realized gains of $185 million, $1.3 billion, and $292 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. We recognized gross realized losses of $295 million, $143 million, and $143 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively.

Equity Investments The following discusses our marketable equity securities, non-marketable equity securities, gains and losses on marketable and non-marketable equity securities, as well as our equity securities accounted for under the equity method. Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 and 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets. All gains and losses on marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net. Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement alternative). All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods using the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. 56 ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT ", "PART II ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA GAINS AND LOSSES ON MARKETABLE AND NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES Gains and losses reflected in other income (expense), net, for our marketable and non-marketable equity securities are summarized below (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 Net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period $ 1,458 2019 $ 4,002 Net unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities held as of the end of the period(1) Total gain (loss) recognized in other income (expense), net $ 5,460 (301) 2,950 $ 2,649 (1) Includes net gains of $4.1 billion and $1.8 billion related to non-marketable equity securities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively. In the table above, net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period reflects the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later. Cumulative net gains on equity securities sold during the period, which is summarized in the following table (in millions), represents the total net gains (losses) recognized after the initial purchase date of the equity security. While these net gains may have been reflected in periods prior to the period of sale, we believe they are important supplemental information as they reflect the economic realized gain on the securities sold during the period. Cumulative net gains is calculated as the difference between the sale price and the initial purchase price for the equity security sold during the period.

EQUITY SECURITIES ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD Equity securities accounted for under the equity method had a carrying value of approximately $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2019. Our share of gains and losses including impairment are included as a component of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 7 for further details on other income (expense), net. Derivative Financial Instruments We classify our foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments. We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. We record changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of the derivatives in the Consolidated Statements of Income as either other income (expense), net, or revenues, or in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in AOCI, as discussed below. Any components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in the same income statement line as the hedged item. We enter into foreign currency contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also use interest rate derivative contracts to hedge interest rate exposures on our fixed income securities and debt issuances. Our program is not used for trading or speculative purposes. We enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further reduce credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements under which the counterparty is required to provide collateral when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. We can take possession of the collateral in the event of counterparty default. As of December 31, 2018 and 2019, we received cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements of $327 million and $252 million, respectively, which was included in other current assets. 58 ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT ", "PART II ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA CASH FLOW HEDGES We use foreign currency forwards and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options), designated as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The notional principal of these contracts was approximately $11.8 billion and $13.2 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less. For forwards and option contracts, we exclude the change in the forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial value of the excluded component is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument and recognized in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI. We reflect the gains or losses of a cash flow hedge included in our hedge effective assessment as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify these gains and losses to revenues when the hedged transactions are recorded. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI are immediately reclassified to other income (expense), net. As of December 31, 2019, the net accumulated loss on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $82 million, of which $82 million is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months. FAIR VALUE HEDGES We use forward contracts designated as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We exclude changes in forward points for the forward contracts from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net. The notional principal of these contracts was $2.0 billion and $455 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items. NET INVESTMENT HEDGES We use forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. We exclude changes in forward points for the forward contracts from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net. The notional principal of these contracts was $6.7 billion and $9.3 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recognized in AOCI as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment. OTHER DERIVATIVES Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a subsidiary.

Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) Consolidated VIEs We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct activities that most significantly affect their economic performance and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or benefits. The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to us.

CALICO Calico is a life science company with a mission to harness advanced technologies to increase our understanding of the biology that controls lifespan. In September 2014, AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie) and Calico entered into a research and development collaboration agreement intended to help both companies discover, develop, and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. In the second quarter of 2018, AbbVie and Calico amended the collaboration agreement resulting in an increase in total commitments. As of December 31, 2019, AbbVie has contributed $1,250 million to fund the collaboration pursuant to the agreement. As of December 31, 2019, Calico has contributed $500 million and has committed up to an additional $750 million. Calico has used its scientific expertise to establish a world-class research and development facility, with a focus on drug discovery and early drug development; and AbbVie provides scientific and clinical development support and its commercial expertise to bring new discoveries to market. Both companies share costs and profits for projects covered under this agreement equally. AbbVie\u2019s contribution has been recorded as a liability on Calico\u2019s financial statements, which is reduced and reflected as a reduction to research and development expense as eligible research and development costs are incurred by Calico. As of December 31, 2019, we have contributed $480 million to Calico in exchange for Calico convertible preferred units and are committed to fund up to an additional $750 million on an as-needed basis and subject to certain conditions. VERILY Verily is a life science and healthcare company with a mission to make the world\u2019s health data useful so that people enjoy healthier lives. In December 2018, Verily received $900 million in cash from a $1.0 billion investment round. The remaining $100 million was received in the first quarter of 2019. As of December 31, 2019, Verily has received an aggregate amount of $1.8 billion from sales of equity securities to external investors. These transactions were accounted for as equity transactions and no gain or loss was recognized. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Verily obtained a controlling financial interest in Onduo, an existing equity method investment. The transaction resulted in a $357 million gain from the revaluation of the previously held economic interest, which was recognized in other income (expense), net. Unconsolidated VIEs Certain of our non-marketable investments, including certain renewable energy investments accounted for under the equity method and certain other investments in private companies, are VIEs. The renewable energy entities\u2019 activities involve power generation using renewable sources. Private companies that we invest in are primarily early stage companies. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we do not consolidate these VIEs in our consolidated financial statements. The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding commitments. We have determined that the single source of our exposure to these VIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs were not material as of December 31, 2018 and 2019. 64 ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT ", "PART II ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Note 6.

An aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.7 billion of the Google Notes was exchanged for approximately $1.7 billion of Alphabet notes with identical interest rate and maturity. Because the exchange was between a parent and the subsidiary company and for substantially identical notes, the change was treated as a debt modification for accounting purposes with no gain or loss recognized.

Acquisitions 2019 Acquisitions LOOKER In December 2019, we obtained all regulatory clearances necessary to close the acquisition of Looker, a unified platform for business intelligence, data applications and embedded analytics for $2.4 billion, with integration pending approval from a UK regulatory review. The addition of Looker to Google Cloud is expected to help customers accelerate how they analyze data, deliver business intelligence, and build data-driven applications. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded based on a preliminary valuation and our estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period. The $2.4 billion purchase price includes our previously held equity interest and excludes post acquisition compensation arrangements. In aggregate, $91 million was cash acquired, $290 million was attributed to intangible assets, $1.9 billion to goodwill and $48 million to net assets acquired. Goodwill was recorded in the Google segment and primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. OTHER ACQUISITIONS During the year ended December 31, 2019, we completed other acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for total consideration of approximately $1.0 billion.

These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings and expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas. Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions, including Looker, have not been presented because they are not material to the consolidated results of operations, either individually or in the aggregate. For all intangible assets acquired and purchased during the year ended December 31, 2019, patents and developed technology have a weighted-average useful life of 3.5 years, customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 6.3 years, and trade names and other have a weighted-average useful life of 4.5 years.

Additionally, we have a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.

The EC decision imposed a fine of \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019. While each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. From time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations by competition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. For example, in August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice requesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain of our business practices. Attorneys general from 51 U.S. states and territories have also opened antitrust investigations into certain of our business practices. We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the United States, and other regulators around the world. PATENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others\u2019 intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices, and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate 70 ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT ", "PART II ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products. Furthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against certain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business. In 2010, Oracle America, Inc. (Oracle) brought a copyright lawsuit against Google in the Northern District of California, alleging that Google\u2019s Android operating system infringes Oracle\u2019s copyrights related to certain Java application programming interfaces. After trial, final judgment was entered by the district court in favor of Google on June 8, 2016, and the court decided post-trial motions in favor of Google. Oracle appealed and on March 27, 2018, the appeals court reversed and remanded the case for a trial on damages. On May 29, 2018, we filed a petition for a rehearing at the Federal Circuit, and on August 28, 2018, the Federal Circuit denied the petition. On January 24, 2019, we filed a petition to the Supreme Court of the United States to review this case. On April 29, 2019, the Supreme Court requested the views of the Solicitor General regarding our petition. On September 27, 2019, the Solicitor General recommended denying our petition, and we provided our response on October 16, 2019. On November 15, 2019, the Supreme Court granted our petition and made a decision to review the case. If the Supreme Court does not rule in our favor, the case will be remanded to the district court for further determination of the remaining issues in the case, including damages, if any. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and are defending ourselves vigorously. Given the nature of this case, we are unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if any, arising from this matter. OTHER We are also regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition, intellectual property, privacy, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. Such claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other adverse consequences. Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. With respect to our outstanding matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred. NON-INCOME TAXES We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We believe these matters are without merit and we are defending ourselves vigorously. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations.

Stockholders\u2019 Equity Convertible Preferred Stock Our board of directors has authorized 100 million shares of convertible preferred stock, $0.001 par value, issuable in series. As of December 31, 2018 and 2019, no shares were issued or outstanding. Class A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock Our board of directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C capital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law. Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock. Share Repurchases In January 2018, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $8.6 billion of its Class C capital stock. In January and July 2019, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $12.5 billion and $25.0 billion of its Class C capital stock, respectively. Share repurchases pursuant to the January 2018 and January 2019 authorizations were completed in 2019. The repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, we repurchased and subsequently retired 8.2 million shares of Alphabet Class C capital stock for an aggregate amount of $9.1 billion and 15.3 million shares of Alphabet Class C capital stock for an aggregate amount of $18.4 billion, respectively. Note 12. Net Income Per Share We compute net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares. The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of Class B common stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our board of directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our board of directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shares and Class C capital stock as if the earnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis. In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, the net income per share amounts are the same for Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc. 72 ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT ", "PART II ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA The following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands and per share amounts): Year Ended December 31, 2017 Class A Class B Class C Basic net income per share: Numerator Allocation of undistributed earnings $ 5,438 $ 862 $ 6,362 Denominator Number of shares used in per share computation Basic net income per share 297,604 47,146 348,151 $ 18.27 $ 18.27 $ 18.27 $ 5,438 $ 862 $ 6,362 Diluted net income per share: Numerator Allocation of undistributed earnings for basic computation Reallocation of undistributed earnings as a result of conversion of Class B to Class A shares 862 0 0 Reallocation of undistributed earnings (74) (14) 74 Allocation of undistributed earnings $ 6,226 $ 848 $ 6,436 Denominator Number of shares used in basic computation 297,604 47,146 348,151 Conversion of Class B to Class A common shares outstanding 47,146 0 0 Restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares 1,192 0 9,491 Weighted-average effect of dilutive securities Add: Number of shares used in per share computation Diluted net income per share 345,942 $ 18.00 47,146 $ 18.00 357,642 $ 18.00 Year Ended December 31, 2018 Class A Class B Class C Basic net income per share: Numerator Allocation of undistributed earnings $ 13,200 $ 2,072 $ 15,464 Denominator Number of shares used in per share computation Basic net income per share 298,548 46,864 349,728 $ 44.22 $ 44.22 $ 44.22 $ 13,200 $ 2,072 $ 15,464 Diluted net income per share: Numerator Allocation of undistributed earnings for basic computation Reallocation of undistributed earnings as a result of conversion of Class B to Class A shares 2,072 0 0 Reallocation of undistributed earnings (146) (24) 146 Allocation of undistributed earnings $ 15,126 $ 2,048 $ 15,610 Denominator Number of shares used in basic computation 298,548 46,864 349,728 Weighted-average effect of dilutive securities Add: Conversion of Class B to Class A common shares outstanding 46,864 0 0 Restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares 689 0 7,456 Number of shares used in per share computation Diluted net income per share 346,101 $ 43.70 46,864 $ 43.70 357,184 $ 43.70 ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT 73 ", "PART II ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Year Ended December 31, 2019 Class A Class B Class C Basic net income per share: Numerator Allocation of undistributed earnings $ 14,846 $ 2,307 $ 17,190 Denominator Number of shares used in per share computation Basic net income per share 299,402 46,527 346,667 $ 49.59 $ 49.59 $ 49.59 $ 14,846 $ 2,307 $ 17,190 Diluted net income per share: Numerator Allocation of undistributed earnings for basic computation Reallocation of undistributed earnings as a result of conversion of Class B to Class A shares 2,307 0 0 Reallocation of undistributed earnings (126) (20) 126 Allocation of undistributed earnings $ 17,027 $ 2,287 $ 17,316 Denominator Number of shares used in basic computation 299,402 46,527 346,667 Weighted-average effect of dilutive securities Add: Conversion of Class B to Class A common shares outstanding 46,527 0 0 Restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares 413 0 5,547 Number of shares used in per share computation Diluted net income per share 74 ALPHABET INC. \u25cf ANNUAL REPORT 346,342 $ 49.16 46,527 $ 49.16 352,214 $ 49.16 ", "PART II ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Note 13.

Incentive and non-qualified stock options, or rights to purchase common stock, are generally granted for a term of 10 years. RSUs granted to participants under the 2012 Stock Plan generally vest over four years contingent upon employment or service with us on the vesting date. As of December 31, 2019, there were 37,982,435 shares of stock reserved for future issuance under our Stock Plan. Additionally, we have stock-based awards that may be settled in the stock of certain of our Other Bets. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, total stock-based compensation expense was $7.9 billion, $10.0 billion and $11.7 billion, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock of $7.7 billion, $9.4 billion, and $10.8 billion, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, we recognized tax benefits on total stock-based compensation expense, which are reflected in the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income, of $1.6 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.8 billion, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, tax benefit realized related to awards vested or exercised during the period was $2.7 billion, $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.

Effective 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and created new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and certain relatedparty payments. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2017. As we collected and prepared necessary data, and interpreted the additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, we made adjustments, over the course of 2018, to the provisional amounts including refinements to deferred taxes. The accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act was completed as of December 31, 2018. Transition tax The Tax Act required us to pay U.S. income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% to the extent of foreign cash and certain other net current assets and 8% on the remaining earnings. We recorded a provisional amount for our transitional tax liability and income tax expense of $10.2 billion as of December 31, 2017. Subsequent adjustments in 2018 and 2019 were not material. Deferred tax effects Due to the change in the statutory tax rate from the Tax Act, we remeasured our deferred taxes as of December 31, 2017 to reflect the reduced rate that will apply in future periods when these deferred taxes are settled or realized.

The U.S. Tax Court issued the final decision on December 28, 2015. As a result of that decision, we recorded a tax benefit related to the anticipated reimbursement of cost share payment for previously shared stock-based compensation costs. On June 7, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned the 2015 Tax Court decision in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, and upheld the portion of the Treasury regulations issued under IRC Section 482 requiring related-party participants in a cost sharing arrangement to share stock-based compensation costs.

If not utilized, the federal and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2021 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2020. It is more likely than not that certain net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized; therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance against them. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations under the tax laws of the different jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2019, our California research and development credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $3.0 billion that can be carried over indefinitely.

The decrease in gross unrecognized tax benefits in 2017 and 2019 was primarily as a result of the resolution of multi-year audits.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions, our two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS completed its examination through our 2015 tax years; all issues have been concluded and the IRS will commence its examination of our 2016 through 2018 tax returns. We have also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. We continue to defend any and all such claims as presented. The tax years 2011 through 2018 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions. We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management\u2019s expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2019, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We rely extensively on information systems to manage our business and summarize and report operating results. In 2019, we began a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system, which will replace much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain the Company\u2019s financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve data management and provide timely information to the Company\u2019s management team. The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years, with initial changes to our general ledger and consolidated financial reporting to take place in 2020. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. However, as the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we will change our processes and procedures which, in turn, could result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting. As such changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. \u2014\u2014 ITEM 9B.
